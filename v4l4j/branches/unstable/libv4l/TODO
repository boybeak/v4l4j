TODO List:
- Add support for changing capture parameters that can be changed while
  capturing (tuner frequency, video input, video standard, frame interval...)
- Add methods to set multiple extended controls at once
- Reorganise/clean up header files.
- Implement setting of frequency for TV tuners.
- Add probe for TV-tuner drivers (bttv, ivtv, mxb, ...)
- Add support for setting the fps, instead of having it done by the application
- Add probe for more drivers (need some help from people having hardware for that).
- libv4l is NOT reentrant and does NOT implement a proper locking scheme yet.
  Therefore, it is the caller's responsibility to ensure accesses to libv4l2
  are synchronised.
