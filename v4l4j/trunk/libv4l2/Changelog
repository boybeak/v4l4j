v0.3.1:
- Groupped open_device() and check_cap_param() under init_libv4l2() to fix an
  issue with controls being listed before checking if the video device is V4L2
- as a consequence, close_device() is now called by del_libv4l2()

v0.3.0:
- Fixed buffer overrun issues with probe-pwc
- dropped frame.c and frame.h
