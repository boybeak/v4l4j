TODO List:

- libv4l2 is NOT reentrant and does NOT implement a proper locking scheme yet.
Therefore, it is the caller's responsibility to ensure accesses to libv4l2 are
synchronised.

- libv4l2 is hard-coded to request the YUV420 format during captures. Help from
users with hardware supporting/requiring a different format is apprciated.
