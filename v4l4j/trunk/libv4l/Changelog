v0.5.4:
- replaced libv4l generic code with a struct libv4l_actions to avoid the
  overhead of calling two methods to get the job done(1 method to check the
  V4L version and another to do the job). Instead, the user now calls
  the right method straight away by using struct libv4l_actions which is
  set at initialisation and points to the right methods straight away.
  
v0.5.3:
- Improved mmap code for V4L1
- added error return codes and improved console output when initialisation
  & setup of video device fails
- added support for more image formats. The whole list :
  YUV420 - RGB24 - RGB32 - YUYV - RGB555 - RGB565 - GREY
- user can now specify a list of acceptable image formats 

v0.5.1:
- Added support for V4L1 devices
- renamed to libv4l


v0.3.1:
- Groupped open_device() and check_cap_param() under init_libv4l2() to fix an
  issue with controls being listed before checking if the video device is V4L2
- as a consequence, close_device() is now called by del_libv4l2()

v0.3.0:
- Fixed buffer overrun issues with probe-pwc
- dropped frame.c and frame.h
