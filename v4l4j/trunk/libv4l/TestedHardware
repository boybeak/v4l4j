libv4l has been compiled and tested succesfully on the following platforms:
- Ubuntu 7.10 - i386
- Ubuntu 8.04 - i386
- Debian Etch - i386

Tested video devices:
- 046d:08b2 Logitech, Inc. QuickCam Pro 4000 (pwc driver)
- 046d:0840 Logitech, Inc. QuickCam Express (qc-usb driver)
- 046d:08b5 Logitech, Inc. QuickCam Sphere (pwc driver)
- 041e:401c Creative Technology, Ltd WebCam NX [PD1110] (gspca driver)
- 046d:0992 Logitech, Inc. Quickcam Communicate Deluxe (linux uvc driver)
- BT848 4-channel PCI capture card (bttv driver)

Currently, libv4l will probe and detect the following drivers:
- PWC 		v10.0.13
  PWC is already a V4L2 driver. Most of its private ioctls are already
  exported as V4L2 controls, except for the following three (which should be
  exported as extended controls in the camera control class in the future ?)
  Exported private ioctls:
    VIDIOCPWCMPTRESET (Pan/Tilt reset))
    VIDIOCPWCMPTGANGLE (Get Pan/Tilt angle)
    VIDIOCPWCMPTSANGLE (Set Pan/Tilt angle)

- gspca 	v01.00.20
  gspca in its current version is still a V4L1 driver although the author
  is actively working on porting it to V4L2. But for now, a few private
  ioctls dont have a V4L1 control counterpart, so libv4l exports the
  following private ioctls:
    SPCASVIDIOPARAM / SPCAGVIDIOPARAM (Set and Get autobrightness, quality,
    frame interval and image flicker)

- qc-usb	v0.6.6
  qc-usb (Quickcam driver) is V4L1 driver and many private ioctls are not
  available as V4L1 control. libv4l exposes the following ioctls:
    VIDIOCQCSSETTLE / VIDIOCQCGSETTLE (Let Brigthness settle ???)
    VIDIOCQCSCOMPRESS / VIDIOCQCGCOMPRESS (compression factor)
    VIDIOCQCSQUALITY / VIDIOCQCGQUALITY (interpolation)
    VIDIOCQCSADAPTIVE / VIDIOCQCGADAPTIVE (autobrightness)
    VIDIOCQCSEQUALIZE / VIDIOCQCGEQUALIZE (equalise image)
