TODO List:
- Implement setting of frequency for TV tuners.
- Add support for setting the fps, instead of having it done by the application.
- Add probe for more drivers (need some help from people having hardware for that).
- Reorganised/clean up header files.
- libv4l is NOT reentrant and does NOT implement a proper locking scheme yet.
  Therefore, it is the caller's responsibility to ensure accesses to libv4l2
  are synchronised.
