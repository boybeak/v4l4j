This page lists the platforms on which v4l4j is known to compile, and the various video devices which work with v4l4j.

*Please, help me expand this list. If you have a successful (or unsuccessful) experience with a specific video device / platform not listed on this page, please take a few minutes to post a comment on the [http://groups.google.com/group/v4l4j v4l4j mailing list].*

==Tested Platforms==
libv4l has been compiled and tested successfully on the following platforms:
 * Ubuntu 7.10 - x86 
 * Ubuntu 8.04 - x86 & x86_64
 * Debian Etch - x86
 * Debian Lenny - Neo FreeRunner

==Tested video devices and drivers==
|| *Device IDs* || *Device Name* || *Device Driver* ||
|| USB - 046d:08b2 || Logitech, Inc. QuickCam Pro 4000 || pwc (linux kernel 2.6.24 & 2.6.26) ||
|| USB - 046d:0840 || Logitech, Inc. QuickCam Express || qc-usb (v0.6.6) ||
|| USB - 046d:08b5 || Logitech, Inc. QuickCam Sphere || pwc (linux kernel 2.6.24 & 2.6.26) ||
|| USB - 041e:401c || Creative Technology, Ltd WebCam NX [PD1110] || gspca (v01.00.20) ||
|| USB - 046d:0992 || Logitech, Inc. Quickcam Communicate Deluxe || linux uvc (SVn r246) ||
|| PCI - 109e:036e || BT848 4-channel PCI capture card || bttv (linux kernel 2.6.24 & 2.6.26) ||

Currently, libv4l will probe and detect the following drivers/features:
 * *PWC (linux kernel v2.6.26)*
 PWC is already a V4L2 driver. Most of its private ioctls are already exported as V4L2 controls, except for the following three (which should be exported as extended controls in the camera control class in the future ?). Exported private ioctls:
  * VIDIOCPWCMPTRESET (Pan/Tilt reset))
  * VIDIOCPWCMPTGANGLE (Get Pan/Tilt angle)
  * VIDIOCPWCMPTSANGLE (Set Pan/Tilt angle)

 * *gspca (v01.00.20)*
 gspca in its current version is still a V4L1 driver although the author is actively working on porting it to V4L2. But for now, a few private ioctls dont have a V4L1 control counterpart, so libv4l exports the following private ioctls:
  * SPCASVIDIOPARAM / SPCAGVIDIOPARAM (Set and Get autobrightness, quality, frame interval and image flicker)

 * *qc-usb (v0.6.6)*
 qc-usb (Quickcam driver) is V4L1 driver and many private ioctls are not available as V4L1 control. libv4l exposes the following ioctls:
  * VIDIOCQCSSETTLE / VIDIOCQCGSETTLE (Let Brigthness settle ???)
  * VIDIOCQCSCOMPRESS / VIDIOCQCGCOMPRESS (compression factor)
  * VIDIOCQCSQUALITY / VIDIOCQCGQUALITY (interpolation)
  * VIDIOCQCSADAPTIVE / VIDIOCQCGADAPTIVE (autobrightness)
  * VIDIOCQCSEQUALIZE / VIDIOCQCGEQUALIZE (equalise image)

* *v4l2 VIDIOC_G_PARM ioctl*
 If ioctl VIDIOC_G_PARM is supported by the driver, libv4l will create two controls to get/set the frame rate:
  * VIDIOC_G_PARM / VIDIOC_S_PARM (adjust FPS)
